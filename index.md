### Decentranet

Using IPFS and Blockchain to make a Decentralized Internet.

```markdown
Decentranet is a combination of three technologies. IPFS, Blockchain and Encryption. With Decentranet, 
we aim to secure data from wireless sensors by creating a network immune to attacks that exploit their 
single point of failure and from any other external threats. Any data uploaded on Decentranet will be 
encrypted and then distributed among all the nodes. This data will be identified by its cryptographic 
hash value. That means any modification or change made to the uploaded data will not go unnoticed. 
In this way we can make wireless sensor networks a much more reliable way of monitoring or collecting 
data. This project is beneficial for every industry that uses sensors or generates some data such as 
the military, industrial, agricultural, financial and even the medical sector.
